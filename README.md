## What is Optimized Claw?

**Optimized Claw** is a production-hardened fork of [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — the open-source personal AI assistant. It tracks upstream closely but ships battle-tested fixes, multi-agent structure, security hardening, and infrastructure improvements needed to run OpenClaw reliably in production with multiple agents.

Everything from upstream works as-is. Optimized Claw adds the layer on top: per-agent browser containers, autonomous consciousness loops, content security, memory improvements, Docker reliability fixes, and tooling that makes multi-agent deployments actually stable.

If you want a single-agent personal assistant, upstream OpenClaw is great. If you want to run a **team of agents** on a server, keeping them secure, self-aware, and structured for multi-agent operation — this fork is for you.

The public brand is **Optimized Claw**, but the runtime, CLI, package layout, and config paths stay `openclaw` for upstream compatibility.

## Best Fit

Optimized Claw is a better fit than stock upstream if you are:

- running multiple long-lived agents on one gateway
- deploying primarily with Docker or server-hosted infrastructure
- relying on per-agent browser isolation and scoped credentials
- wanting agents that autonomously self-improve, reflect, and maintain their own memory
- using upstream channels like Matrix/Element, Telegram, Discord, Slack, or WhatsApp but wanting a more production-oriented baseline
- keeping a fork in sync with upstream while preserving a known patch set

### 🧠 Consciousness & Memory

This fork has a significantly deeper memory stack than upstream. Rather than treating each session as isolated, agents carry context forward across resets — and actively reflect on their own behavior.

**How context carryover works:**

1. When a session resets, `session-context-summary.ts` runs trajectory compression: the first/last turns of the conversation are preserved verbatim, and the middle is compressed into key decisions, tool usage, and user intents. This gets written to `memory/session-context.md` and is loaded automatically on the next session boot.
2. Every session is indexed into an FTS5 SQLite database (`memory/sessions.db`) so the `session_search` tool can do fast keyword lookup across all past conversations — complementing the embedding-based `memory_search`.
3. The 3-tier reflection system runs entirely autonomously: self-review (every 12h), consciousness loop (every 5h by default, dynamically adjustable via `NEXT_WAKE:` directives), and deep review (every 48h). These are not just prompts — they write structured entries to `memory/self-review.md`, `diary.md`, and the improvement backlog, which feed back into future heartbeats.

The result: agents remember what they did, learn from their patterns, and carry their state forward even after compactions.

### 💾 Backup & Restore

A full lifecycle backup system runs on a configurable schedule (default: every 12 hours):

1. **Create** — `openclaw backup create` produces a verified `.tar.gz` archive containing config, state, credentials, and workspace
2. **Verify** — archive integrity is checked before upload. If corrupt, the cycle retries (up to 3 attempts) before alerting
3. **Upload** — verified archive is stored in Supabase Storage (`openclaw-backups` bucket) with a 7-day expiry
4. **Local copy** — a local copy is saved to `~/.clawdbot/local-backups/` (configurable via `MOLTBOT_LOCAL_BACKUP_DIR`), retained for 14 days
5. **Alert on failure** — if all attempts fail, the dashboard is notified via the `/alert` endpoint

Restores are one-click from the dashboard, or import any `.tar.gz` from a community self-hosted instance to migrate to managed hosting.

## Deployment Paths

Optimized Claw supports the same runtime surfaces as upstream OpenClaw, but the recommended fork install paths are:

- **Git checkout** for direct control and easy upstream syncs
- **GHCR images** for Docker deployments

If your deployment tooling pulls container images directly, point it at:

- `ghcr.io/ashneil12/optimized-claw:main`
- `ghcr.io/ashneil12/optimized-claw-browser:main`

If your workflow depends on Matrix/Element or other upstream channels, the existing upstream channel docs and setup flow still apply unless this fork explicitly documents an override.

---

## Fresh Install

### Self-Hosted: macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashneil12/optimized-claw/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

This installer now defaults to a **git checkout of this fork**, not a package-manager install.

### Self-Hosted: Windows

```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashneil12/optimized-claw/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### Manual Source Install

Runtime: **Node ≥22**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashneil12/optimized-claw.git
cd optimized-claw

pnpm install
pnpm build

pnpm openclaw onboard --install-daemon
pnpm openclaw gateway --port 18789 --verbose
```

Install note: the public brand is **Optimized Claw**, but the command stays `openclaw`. For this fork, prefer **git** or **Docker** installs. A plain `npm install -g openclaw` targets the upstream package unless you publish a separate forked npm package.

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Published images:

- `ghcr.io/ashneil12/optimized-claw:main`
- `ghcr.io/ashneil12/optimized-claw-browser:main`

## Upgrading from an Existing OpenClaw Setup

If your current OpenClaw setup is already stable and doing everything you need, you probably **do not** need to move.

Switch to Optimized Claw if you specifically want the fork-only behavior: multi-agent structure, browser-container hardening, consciousness loops, or the other production patches listed above.

### Existing Source Checkout

Safest path:

1. Back up `~/.openclaw`
2. Stop the currently running gateway/service
3. Clone this fork into a new directory
4. Build it and run onboarding/install-daemon from the new checkout
5. Run `openclaw doctor`
6. Restart the gateway from the new install

The runtime and config paths stay `openclaw` / `~/.openclaw`, so your existing configuration can carry over. That also means you should keep a backup before switching.

### Existing Docker Deployment

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not pull the official `openclawai/openclaw` image to update.** That is the upstream image — it does not include any of the patches in this fork. Pulling it will silently revert your full-profile enforcement, browser tool wiring, memory stack, and every other customisation described in this README.

Update your image references to this fork's images:

- `ghcr.io/ashneil12/optimized-claw:main`
- `ghcr.io/ashneil12/optimized-claw-browser:main`

Then pull and restart:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

### Existing npm Install

There is no direct fork-owned npm upgrade path yet. If you installed with `npm install -g openclaw`, you are still on the official package stream.

To move to this fork, reinstall via:

- the git-based installer above
- a manual source checkout
- Docker / GHCR images

---

## Keeping Optimized Claw Up to Date

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do NOT update through the official OpenClaw update mechanism (`openclaw update`, `npm update openclaw`, or pulling the upstream Docker image).** Because the source code in this fork has diverged significantly from upstream — different `enforce-config.mjs`, patched Docker entrypoint, custom tool wiring, modified CDP helpers, and more — running an upstream update will revert most of those changes. You will likely end up with broken browser containers, agents locked to a narrow tool profile, missing backup scripts, and a non-functional memory stack. It is not a simple undo.

### The Correct Update Path

When upstream OpenClaw releases a new version:

1. **Wait** — Optimized Claw typically updates within **24–48 hours** of each upstream release. The update is tested to ensure all the fork-specific features continue to work before it's published.
2. **Pull this fork's images** (Docker) or merge from this fork's `main` branch (source checkout). Do **not** merge directly from `openclaw/openclaw` unless you know what you're doing and have read `OPENCLAW_CONTEXT.md` front to back.
3. **Verify the patches survived** using the commands below.

If you use Docker (the recommended path), updating is just:

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

The fork image already has everything tested and rebased.

### If You Have Your Own Local Changes

If you've made additional modifications on top of Optimized Claw, make sure they're documented **before** you pull any update:

- Write down which files you changed and why — even a quick comment at the top of the file is enough
- Check `OPENCLAW_CONTEXT.md` to see if your change touches a file that's already patched; if so, note what you added so you can re-apply it after updating
- Consider keeping a `LOCAL_CHANGES.md` in your checkout as a personal diff log

Updates that aren't documented are almost always lost. A 3-line note written before updating saves hours of debugging after.

### Upstream Sync Reference (for fork maintainers)

Optimized Claw tracks `openclaw/openclaw` main branch. Custom patches are documented in:

- **[LOCAL_PATCHES.md](LOCAL_PATCHES.md)** — Critical patches with per-file verification commands
- **[OPENCLAW_CONTEXT.md](OPENCLAW_CONTEXT.md)** — Complete modification inventory with post-sync checklist
- **[OPENCLAW_CHANGELOG.md](OPENCLAW_CHANGELOG.md)** — Full history of every custom change with rationale

After every upstream sync, verify all patches survived:

```bash
grep -c 'httpRequestWithHostOverride' src/browser/cdp.helpers.ts  # expect ≥ 1
grep -c 'Promise.all' src/browser/server-context.ts               # expect ≥ 1
grep -c 'agentId.*resolveSessionAgentId' src/agents/openclaw-tools.ts  # expect ≥ 1
grep -c 'tools.profile = "full"' enforce-config.mjs              # expect ≥ 1
```

## Configuration

Optimized Claw uses the same configuration as upstream OpenClaw. See:

- [Full configuration reference](https://docs.openclaw.ai/gateway/configuration)
- [Getting started guide](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/getting-started)
- [Channel setup](https://docs.openclaw.ai/channels)

Fork-specific additions are documented in `OPENCLAW_CONTEXT.md`.
